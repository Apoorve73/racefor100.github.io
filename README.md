## Rules of Gameplay

- After hitting the `PLAY` button, you will be prompted to enter your name.
- Then you have to guess a number between 1 and 10, and choose that number from
  the buttons below.
- Similarly, the computer will guess one such number to add it to yours, and
  will return the `SUM`.
- The game keeps on going this way, alternatively.
- The one whose number, makes the sum reach 100 first, wins the game.

> **Tip**: If you get the trick, you will always **WIN!**
