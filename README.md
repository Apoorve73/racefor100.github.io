# Welcome to RACE FOR THE 100

This **Guess to Win** based game is developed as a part of **100DaysOfCode**. Try playing around with the game. This is a development level project.

**Contrbution.md** will be *updated soon*.

*The page is* **DEPLOYED** *for the* **master branch**.

## Rules of the game
* After hiting the `PLAY` button, you will be prompted to enter your name.
* Then you have to guess a number between 1 and 10, and choose that number from the buttons below.
* Similarly, the computer will guess one such number to add it to yours, and will return the `SUM`.
* The game keeps on going this way, alternatively.
* The one whose number, makes the sum reach 100 first, wins the game.

> **Tip**: If you get the trick, you will always **WIN!**
